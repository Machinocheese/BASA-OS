# BASA-OS
In a desperate attempt to overthrow the reign of the lord of knowledge Mr. Bubbles, the 4 CS-teers must band together to create the ultimate weapon - to construct an operating system so powerful that it can pierce the heavens.

On a side note, this is an exploratory attempt into creating an OS, which classes haven't adequately covered enough.

Current run command:
```make```

To clean up after compiling:
```make clean```
